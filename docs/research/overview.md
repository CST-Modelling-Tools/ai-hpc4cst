## Scientific Vision

AI-HPC4CST advances the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and High-Performance Computing (HPC) to enable large-scale, simulation-driven optimisation of complex engineering systems.

The project is centred on solar tower technology as a computationally demanding and industrially relevant case study. However, its scientific ambition extends beyond CST to problems characterised by high-dimensional design spaces, strong physical coupling, and simulation-in-the-loop optimisation.

## Core Research Hypothesis

The central hypothesis of AI-HPC4CST is:

> Advanced AI-enhanced optimisation strategies, combined with scalable HPC workflows, enable integral and multi-objective optimisation of complex systems beyond the practical limits of conventional deterministic approaches.

Traditional optimisation techniques struggle with nonlinear behaviour, local minima, and the computational cost of multi-physics simulations. The project investigates stochastic, evolutionary, and AI-driven optimisation strategies capable of navigating such environments efficiently.

## Research Focus Areas

The research programme integrates three complementary domains.

### 1. Integral System Optimisation

- Formulation of engineering design as high-dimensional optimisation problems  
- Multi-objective optimisation under physical and operational constraints  
- System-level integration of coupled phenomena  
- Exploration of complex design spaces through simulation-based evaluation  

Solar tower systems provide a representative and challenging application domain for this approach.

### 2. AI-Enhanced Optimisation Strategies

- Stochastic and evolutionary optimisation algorithms  
- Neuroevolution and deep learning approaches for design exploration  
- Hybrid strategies balancing simulation cost and optimisation efficiency  
- Multi-objective optimisation in strongly nonlinear environments  

AI techniques are embedded within optimisation workflows to improve exploration capability and solution quality.

### 3. HPC-Enabled Computational Frameworks

- Parallel simulation and optimisation loops  
- Scalable execution of computationally intensive models  
- Integration of AI techniques within high-performance environments  
- Reproducible and modular computational infrastructures  

HPC enables systematic exploration of design spaces that would otherwise be computationally prohibitive.

## Methodological Approach

AI-HPC4CST adopts a simulation-in-the-loop optimisation paradigm:

1. A parameterised system configuration defines a candidate design  
2. High-fidelity simulations compute relevant performance metrics  
3. AI-enhanced optimisation algorithms guide exploration of the design space  
4. HPC resources ensure scalability and computational feasibility  

This black-box abstraction allows optimisation strategies to operate independently of internal simulation details while iteratively improving system performance.

- AI-enhanced multi-objective optimisation strategies  
- Scalable HPC-enabled computational frameworks  
- Open and reproducible research tools  
- A forward-looking research roadmap for AI–HPC integration in energy systems

## Broader Impact

While solar tower systems serve as the primary demonstrator, the methodological advances of AI-HPC4CST apply to a broader class of problems requiring large-scale, simulation-driven optimisation.

By bridging AI, HPC, and renewable energy engineering, the project contributes to advancing next-generation computational design methodologies.
