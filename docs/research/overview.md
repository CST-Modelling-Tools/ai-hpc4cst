## Scientific Vision

AI-HPC4CST aims to transform the design and optimisation of **central receiver solar tower systems (CST)** through the systematic integration of:

- Artificial Intelligence (AI)
- High-Performance Computing (HPC)
- Physics-based simulation
- Multi-objective optimisation

Solar tower systems involve tightly coupled optical, thermal, structural and operational constraints. Traditional optimisation approaches often rely on sequential or partially decoupled strategies. AI-HPC4CST proposes a shift toward **integral, simulation-driven, multi-objective optimisation frameworks**.

## Core Research Hypothesis

The central hypothesis of the project is:

> The combined use of AI-based surrogate modelling and HPC-accelerated optimisation can enable integral design strategies that significantly improve performance, reduce computational cost, and enhance reproducibility in CST systems.

The project investigates how machine learning models can approximate expensive simulations while maintaining physical consistency, and how HPC can scale optimisation workflows to realistic design spaces.
