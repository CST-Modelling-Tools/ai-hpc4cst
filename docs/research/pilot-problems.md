## Pilot Problems in AI-HPC4CST

AI-HPC4CST validates its AI–HPC optimisation framework through a set of defined pilot problems within solar tower systems.

These pilot problems serve as realistic, simulation-driven test cases in which the developed optimisation methodologies are applied, evaluated, and refined.

Their purpose is to:

- Demonstrate the integration of AI-enhanced optimisation and HPC workflows  
- Validate optimisation strategies under realistic engineering constraints  
- Assess scalability and robustness of the computational framework  
- Identify practical limitations and improvement opportunities

## Application Domain

Solar tower systems provide a computationally demanding environment characterised by:

- Strong coupling between optical and thermal processes  
- High-dimensional design variables  
- Nonlinear system behaviour  
- Multi-objective performance criteria  

Within this context, pilot problems focus on optimisation challenges involving system configurations, geometric parameters, and operational conditions.

The emphasis is not on isolated component tuning, but on integral optimisation under realistic simulation-based evaluation.

## From Framework Development to Applied Optimisation

The pilot phase follows the technological maturation of the AI and HPC components.

It includes:

- Standardisation and streamlining of optimisation workflows  
- Systematic search for improved design solutions  
- Iterative refinement of optimisation strategies  
- Validation of results through high-fidelity simulations  

This stage transforms methodological development into applied optimisation practice.

## Multi-Objective Optimisation Context

The pilot problems involve multiple competing objectives, such as:

- Optical and thermal performance  
- System efficiency indicators  
- Operational constraints  
- Robustness under varying conditions  

AI-enhanced optimisation strategies are used to explore trade-offs and identify high-quality solutions within this multi-objective landscape.

## Role of HPC in Pilot Validation

The application of optimisation strategies to pilot problems requires:

- Parallel evaluation of candidate configurations  
- Iterative execution of stochastic search processes  
- Efficient management of computational resources  

HPC enables scalable validation and ensures that optimisation results are obtained within feasible timeframes.

## Expected Outcomes

Through the pilot problems, AI-HPC4CST aims to demonstrate:

- Effective integration of AI and HPC in simulation-driven optimisation  
- Improved optimisation capability for complex solar tower configurations  
- Robust and scalable computational workflows  
- Practical insights to inform future research directions  

The pilot problems represent the bridge between methodological innovation and validated optimisation outcomes in advanced solar energy systems.
