## High-Performance Computing in AI-HPC4CST

High-Performance Computing (HPC) is a structural enabler of simulation-driven optimisation in AI-HPC4CST.

The project addresses optimisation problems in which each candidate design must be evaluated through computationally intensive simulations. When such evaluations are embedded within stochastic or evolutionary search processes, computational demand grows rapidly.

HPC provides the scalability required to make large-scale, multi-objective optimisation feasible.

## HPC in Simulation-Driven Optimisation

AI-HPC4CST adopts a simulation-in-the-loop optimisation paradigm in which:

- Parameterised system configurations define candidate designs  
- High-fidelity simulations compute performance metrics  
- AI-enhanced optimisation algorithms guide the search process  

In this context, HPC enables:

- Parallel evaluation of large numbers of candidate configurations  
- Reduction of optimisation wall-clock time  
- Systematic exploration of high-dimensional design spaces  

This computational scalability is essential for integral optimisation of complex engineered systems.

## Integration with AI-Based Optimisation

HPC supports advanced AI-enhanced optimisation strategies by:

- Enabling population-based and stochastic search methods  
- Allowing concurrent evaluation of candidate solutions  
- Supporting iterative refinement of optimisation workflows  

The integration of AI and HPC forms a unified computational framework in which optimisation algorithms interact efficiently with simulation engines.

## Scalable Workflow Design

Beyond acceleration, HPC integration focuses on structured and reproducible execution.

The project develops:

- Well-defined optimisation procedures  
- Automated execution of simulation batches  
- Consistent data handling strategies  
- Modular interfaces between optimisation algorithms and simulation tools  

This structured approach ensures robustness and long-term sustainability of the computational framework.

## Computational Infrastructure

The project leverages established high-performance computing resources to ensure:

- Efficient execution of large-scale optimisation campaigns  
- Compatibility with institutional and national HPC infrastructures  
- Adaptability to evolving computational environments  

Scalability is addressed both in terms of problem dimensionality and computational workload.

## Application to Solar Tower Systems

Solar tower systems provide a representative and demanding application domain in which:

- Multi-physics simulations are required  
- Design variables are strongly coupled  
- Multi-objective trade-offs must be explored  

The HPC-enabled optimisation framework is validated in this context while remaining applicable to broader simulation-driven optimisation problems.

## Expected Contributions

The HPC component of AI-HPC4CST aims to deliver:

- Scalable optimisation workflows for simulation-based engineering  
- Robust integration of AI and high-performance computing  
- Efficient exploration of high-dimensional design spaces  
- Reproducible computational infrastructures  

HPC in AI-HPC4CST is therefore not merely an acceleration mechanism, but a foundational element enabling integral optimisation of complex systems.
