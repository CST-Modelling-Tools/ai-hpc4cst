## AI-HPC4CST

**AI-HPC4CST** is an ATRAE research project advancing the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and High-Performance Computing (HPC) for large-scale, simulation-driven optimisation of complex energy systems.

Solar tower technology serves as a demanding and industrially relevant application domain in which these methodologies are developed, tested, and validated.

## Motivation

Many advanced engineering systems require optimisation within high-dimensional design spaces evaluated through computationally intensive simulations.

Such problems are characterised by:

- Strongly coupled multi-physics behaviour  
- Nonlinear system interactions  
- Multi-objective performance trade-offs  
- Repeated simulation-based evaluation  

Under these conditions, conventional deterministic optimisation techniques face significant limitations in scalability and robustness.

AI-HPC4CST addresses these challenges by developing and integrating:

- AI-enhanced stochastic and evolutionary optimisation strategies  
- Simulation-in-the-loop optimisation frameworks  
- Scalable high-performance computational workflows  
- Reproducible and modular research infrastructures  

Solar tower systems provide a representative and technically demanding context in which these approaches are applied and validated.

## Scientific Scope

The project focuses on:

- Integral optimisation of complex engineering systems  
- Integration of AI techniques within multi-objective search processes  
- Scalable HPC-enabled execution of simulation-based evaluation  
- Systematic exploration of high-dimensional parameter spaces  

While centred on solar tower systems as a demonstrator, the methodological developments are relevant to a broader class of simulation-driven optimisation problems in complex energy systems and subsystems.

## Project Structure

AI-HPC4CST is organised around:

- Clearly defined scientific objectives  
- Coordinated work packages covering management, dissemination, technological development, pilot validation, and long-term roadmap definition  
- A structured 48-month timeline  
- Open science and reproducible research practices  

The integration of AI and HPC is progressively developed, applied to defined pilot problems, and consolidated into a forward-looking research roadmap.
