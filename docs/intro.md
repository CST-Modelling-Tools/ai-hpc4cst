## AI-HPC4CST

**AI-HPC4CST** is an ATRAE research project focused on transforming the design and optimisation of concentrating solar thermal (CST) solar tower systems through the combined use of artificial intelligence (AI) and high-performance computing (HPC).

---

## Official Project Title

> *Towards disruptive innovation in advanced solar energy systems through artificial intelligence and high performance computing.*

---

## Motivation

The optimisation of solar tower systems involves:

- High-dimensional design spaces  
- Coupled multi-physics simulations  
- Strongly nonlinear system interactions  
- Multi-objective trade-offs  

Traditional approaches are computationally expensive and difficult to scale.

AI-HPC4CST addresses these challenges by integrating:

- AI-based surrogate modelling  
- Multi-objective optimisation methods  
- High-performance computing infrastructures  
- Reproducible computational workflows
