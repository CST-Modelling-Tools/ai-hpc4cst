## Work Packages Overview

AI-HPC4CST is organised into five coordinated Work Packages (WPs) that structure the project from governance and dissemination to technological development, pilot applications, and long-term strategic impact.

Together, these work packages ensure rigorous execution, development of AI and HPC methodologies, validation through solar tower optimisation challenges, and consolidation of future research directions.

## WP1 – Project Management

WP1 ensures effective coordination and strategic alignment of all project activities throughout the 48-month duration.

Its activities include:

- Coordination of scientific and technical work  
- Monitoring of progress and milestones  
- Interaction with the International Technical Advisory Board (ITAB)  
- Strategic networking with relevant institutions and stakeholders  

This work package guarantees coherent execution and sustained project momentum.

## WP2 – Dissemination and Communication

WP2 ensures that project results are communicated effectively to the scientific community, industry stakeholders, policymakers, and society.

Key activities include:

- Development of a dissemination and exploitation strategy  
- Implementation of open science practices  
- Scientific publications, webinars, and outreach actions  
- Identification and protection of potentially exploitable results  

This work package reinforces transparency, reproducibility, and long-term impact.

## WP3 – AI and HPC

WP3 focuses on the exploration, selection, and implementation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and High-Performance Computing (HPC) technologies within the project framework.

Core activities include:

- Definition of computational procedures and optimisation workflows  
- Evaluation of AI and HPC approaches suitable for large-scale optimisation  
- Implementation and integration of selected technologies  
- Development of associated open-source tools  

This work package provides the technological backbone of AI-HPC4CST.

## WP4 – Solution of Pilot Problems

WP4 applies the developed AI and HPC framework to defined pilot problems in solar tower systems.

Its activities focus on:

- Standardisation and streamlining of optimisation workflows  
- Systematic search for solutions to selected optimisation challenges  
- Validation of the developed framework under realistic engineering conditions  

This work package demonstrates the practical effectiveness of the project’s methodologies.

## WP5 – Research Road Map

WP5 consolidates the knowledge generated during the project and defines future research directions.

It includes:

- Documentation of lessons learned  
- Development of a strategic research roadmap  
- Identification of emerging opportunities for continued innovation  

This work package ensures that AI-HPC4CST delivers not only immediate scientific advances but also a long-term vision for the evolution of AI-enhanced solar energy systems.

## Integrated Perspective

The coordinated execution of these five work packages enables:

- Robust project governance  
- Development and deployment of advanced AI and HPC optimisation technologies  
- Demonstration through solar tower pilot problems  
- Long-term strategic positioning in AI-enhanced energy system optimisation  

Together, they provide a coherent framework for advancing large-scale, simulation-driven optimisation in solar tower systems.
