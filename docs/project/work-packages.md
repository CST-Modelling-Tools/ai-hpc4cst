## Work Packages Overview

AI-HPC4CST is structured into coordinated work packages (WPs) that collectively address methodological development, computational implementation, validation, and dissemination.

Each work package contributes to the development of an integrated AI–HPC optimisation framework for solar tower systems.

## WP1 – Foundations and System Modelling

**Objective:** Establish the physical and computational foundations of the project.

This work package focuses on:

- Definition of representative solar tower configurations  
- Identification of key performance indicators (KPIs)  
- Coupling strategies between optical, thermal, and system-level models  
- Definition of optimisation variables and constraints  

WP1 provides the high-fidelity simulation backbone required for subsequent AI and optimisation developments.

## WP2 – Artificial Intelligence and Surrogate Modelling

**Objective:** Develop AI-based surrogate models for accelerated simulation.

Main tasks include:

- Dataset generation from high-fidelity CST simulations  
- Design and training of machine learning surrogate models  
- Uncertainty-aware and physics-informed modelling strategies  
- Validation against reference simulations  

The goal is to significantly reduce computational cost while preserving predictive accuracy and interpretability.

## WP3 – High-Performance Computing and Scalable Workflows

**Objective:** Enable large-scale optimisation through HPC integration.

Key activities:

- Parallelisation strategies for simulation workflows  
- Distributed optimisation and batch evaluation frameworks  
- Efficient sampling and exploration of high-dimensional design spaces  
- Performance benchmarking and scalability analysis  

WP3 ensures that the optimisation framework can scale to realistic industrial design scenarios.

## WP4 – Multi-Objective Optimisation and Decision Frameworks

**Objective:** Integrate AI and HPC into a unified optimisation strategy.

This work package addresses:

- Multi-objective optimisation algorithms  
- Trade-off analysis (performance–cost–reliability)  
- Constraint handling and robustness strategies  
- Integration of surrogate models within optimisation loops  

WP4 delivers the core optimisation engine of the project.

## WP5 – Demonstration, Validation and Impact

**Objective:** Validate the framework and maximise scientific and societal impact.

Activities include:

- Application to representative solar tower case studies  
- Comparative analysis with conventional design methodologies  
- Publication of scientific results  
- Release of tools and documentation  
- Dissemination and stakeholder engagement  

This work package ensures scientific excellence, transparency, and real-world relevance.

## Cross-Cutting Activities

Across all work packages, the project emphasises:

- Reproducibility and open science principles  
- Documentation and software sustainability  
- Interdisciplinary integration between AI, HPC, and solar thermal engineering  

The coordinated execution of these work packages enables AI-HPC4CST to deliver a coherent and impactful optimisation framework for next-generation solar tower systems.
