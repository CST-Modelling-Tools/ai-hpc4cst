## Project Duration

AI-HPC4CST is developed over a 48-month period, structured around coordinated and partially overlapping work packages.

The timeline reflects progressive integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI), High-Performance Computing (HPC), and solar tower optimisation activities, with continuous dissemination and strategic consolidation.

## Months 1–12: Framework Definition and Initial Integration

During the first year, the project establishes its organisational and technical foundations.

Main activities include:

- Project coordination and establishment of governance mechanisms  
- Definition of computational procedures and optimisation workflows  
- Initial exploration of suitable AI and HPC technologies  
- Development of dissemination and open science strategies  

By the end of this phase, core procedures and workflows are in place to support large-scale optimisation.

---

## Months 12–24: Technology Exploration and Early Implementation

The second phase focuses on consolidating the technological backbone of the project.

Key developments include:

- Systematic evaluation of AI and HPC approaches  
- Progressive implementation of selected technologies  
- Consolidation of scalable computational workflows  
- Ongoing dissemination activities and stakeholder engagement  

By mid-project, the optimisation framework is partially implemented and ready for structured validation.

---

## Months 18–42: Pilot Problem Solution and Validation

From the second year onward, the developed framework is applied to defined pilot optimisation problems in solar tower systems.

Activities include:

- Standardisation and streamlining of workflows  
- Systematic search for optimisation solutions  
- Validation under realistic engineering conditions  
- Continuous refinement of computational tools  

This period represents the core scientific execution phase, where AI and HPC technologies are fully integrated into the optimisation process.

---

## Months 42–48: Consolidation and Research Roadmap

The final phase consolidates results and defines future directions.

Main activities include:

- Documentation of lessons learned  
- Preparation of a strategic research roadmap  
- Final dissemination and knowledge transfer actions  
- Consolidation of long-term collaborations  

This phase ensures continuity beyond the project duration.

---

## Continuous Activities (Months 1–48)

Throughout the entire project duration:

- Project management and coordination remain active  
- Dissemination and communication activities are ongoing  
- Open science principles are implemented  
- Networking with scientific and industrial stakeholders continues

## Structured Progression

The timeline is designed to:

- Ensure early establishment of computational procedures  
- Allow sufficient maturation of AI and HPC technologies  
- Provide an extended validation period for pilot optimisation problems  
- Conclude with strategic consolidation and forward-looking planning  

This structured progression enables coherent development from technological exploration to validated optimisation outcomes in solar tower systems.
