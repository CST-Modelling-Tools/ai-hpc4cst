## Project Objectives

**AI-HPC4CST** (Towards disruptive innovation in advanced solar energy systems through artificial intelligence and high-performance computing) aims to transform the design and optimisation of solar tower systems through the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and high-performance computing (HPC).

The project addresses the growing complexity of concentrating solar tower (CST) systems, where field layout, receiver design, control strategies, and operational constraints are strongly coupled and computationally expensive to evaluate.

### General Objective

To develop an integral, simulation-driven optimisation framework for solar tower systems that combines:

- Artificial intelligence for surrogate modelling and advanced optimisation  
- High-performance computing for scalable and accelerated simulation  
- Multi-objective methodologies for performance–cost–reliability trade-offs  

The ultimate goal is to enable faster design cycles, improved system-level performance, and transparent, reproducible optimisation workflows.

## Specific Objectives

### 1. Develop AI-driven surrogate models
Create and validate machine learning models capable of approximating high-fidelity CST simulations while preserving physical consistency and interpretability.

### 2. Enable large-scale optimisation through HPC
Design and deploy scalable workflows that leverage high-performance computing to explore high-dimensional design spaces efficiently.

### 3. Integrate multi-objective optimisation strategies
Formulate optimisation frameworks capable of balancing optical performance, thermal efficiency, cost, reliability, and operational constraints.

### 4. Ensure reproducibility and open science
Provide open tools, documented workflows, and dissemination materials that facilitate transparency and reuse by the research and industrial community.

### 5. Demonstrate impact through pilot case studies
Validate the developed methods on representative solar tower configurations and realistic operational scenarios.
