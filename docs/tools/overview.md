## Tools Ecosystem

AI-HPC4CST develops and integrates computational tools to support large-scale, simulation-driven optimisation of complex energy systems.

The project follows an open science and open software strategy based on:

- Transparent methodologies  
- Public repositories where appropriate  
- Version-controlled development  
- Reproducible computational workflows  

Rather than a single monolithic application, AI-HPC4CST promotes a modular ecosystem in which optimisation algorithms, simulation engines, and HPC workflows interact through clearly defined interfaces.

## Simulation and Modelling Tools

High-fidelity simulation tools form the computational backbone of the optimisation framework.

These tools are responsible for evaluating candidate system configurations through physics-based modelling, including optical and thermal processes relevant to solar tower systems.

### Tonatiuh++

Tonatiuh++ is a ray-tracing and modelling toolkit within the CST-Modelling-Tools ecosystem.

It supports:

- Heliostat field modelling  
- Optical ray-tracing simulations  
- Evaluation of flux distribution and optical performance  

Within AI-HPC4CST, Tonatiuh++ serves as:

- A simulation engine within optimisation workflows  
- A computational workload for scalable HPC execution  
- A validation platform for AI-enhanced optimisation strategies

## AI-Enhanced Optimisation Components

AI-HPC4CST develops and integrates optimisation components designed to operate within simulation-in-the-loop environments.

These may include:

- Stochastic and evolutionary optimisation modules  
- Multi-objective optimisation frameworks  
- AI-assisted search strategies  
- Adaptive exploration mechanisms for high-dimensional design spaces  

The focus is on enhancing optimisation capability rather than replacing physical simulation models.

Where appropriate, these components will be released with documentation and versioned repositories.

## HPC-Enabled Workflow Integration

A key objective of the project is the structured integration of optimisation workflows with high-performance computing resources.

This includes:

- Parallel evaluation of candidate configurations  
- Scalable execution of optimisation iterations  
- Automated coordination between optimisation algorithms and simulation engines  
- Performance-aware computational strategies  

The goal is to design optimisation workflows that are inherently scalable and robust under increasing computational demand.

## Reproducibility and Workflow Automation

All developed tools aim to support:

- Reproducible optimisation experiments  
- Documented configuration and parameter settings  
- Version-controlled optimisation workflows  
- Transparent data handling and post-processing procedures  

This ensures that results are verifiable, traceable, and reusable by the broader research community.

## Future Developments

As the project progresses, additional software components may include:

- Integrated optimisation libraries  
- Decision-support and visualisation tools  
- Extended simulation–optimisation interfaces  
- Tools supporting large-scale parameter studies  

Each new development will follow the same principles of openness, modularity, and reproducibility.

## Strategic Vision

AI-HPC4CST promotes a modular, scalable computational ecosystem in which:

- Specialised simulation tools  
- AI-enhanced optimisation algorithms  
- High-performance computing workflows  

operate together within a unified, simulation-driven optimisation framework.

This approach ensures flexibility, long-term sustainability, and applicability to complex energy systems and related engineering challenges.
