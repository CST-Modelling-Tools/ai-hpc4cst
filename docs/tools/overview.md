## Tools Ecosystem

AI-HPC4CST develops and integrates open tools to enable reproducible, scalable optimisation of solar tower systems.

The project follows an **open science and open software strategy**:

- Transparent methodologies  
- Public repositories  
- Dedicated development blogs  
- Reproducible computational workflows  

The tools ecosystem is structured so that each major tool has its own documentation hub and development space, while this website provides the overarching project context.

## Tonatiuh++

Tonatiuh++ is a core modelling and ray-tracing tool within the CST-Modelling-Tools ecosystem.

It supports:

- Heliostat field modelling  
- Ray-tracing simulation  
- Optical efficiency evaluation  
- Flux distribution analysis  

Within AI-HPC4CST, Tonatiuh++ serves as:

- A simulation backbone for optimisation workflows  
- A benchmark platform for AI surrogate modelling  
- A computational workload for HPC integration

## AI & Surrogate Modelling Frameworks

AI-HPC4CST develops methodologies for:

- Surrogate modelling of expensive simulations  
- Machine learning–assisted optimisation  
- Multi-objective optimisation acceleration  
- Hybrid AI–physics approaches  

These tools are designed to:

- Reduce the number of required full simulations  
- Enable rapid exploration of design spaces  
- Support large-scale optimisation on HPC systems  

Where possible, frameworks and workflows will be released openly.

## HPC Integration Workflows

A central innovation of AI-HPC4CST is the structured integration of optimisation and HPC execution.

This includes:

- Automated job submission workflows  
- Parallel evaluation of design candidates  
- Scalable optimisation pipelines  
- Performance benchmarking  

The objective is not merely to run simulations on HPC systems, but to **design optimisation workflows that are inherently scalable**.

---

## Reproducibility & Workflow Automation

All developed tools aim to support:

- Reproducible optimisation experiments  
- Version-controlled configurations  
- Documented parameter studies  
- Transparent data processing pipelines  

This ensures that:

- Results can be independently verified  
- Design improvements are traceable  
- Methodological advances are transferable  

---

## Future Tools

The AI-HPC4CST ecosystem is designed to grow.

Future tools may include:

- Dedicated optimisation libraries  
- Decision-support interfaces  
- Visualisation and Pareto-analysis tools  
- Coupled optical–thermal modelling modules  

Each new tool will follow the same principles:

- Open dissemination  
- Clear documentation  
- Reproducible workflows

## Strategic Vision

Rather than a single monolithic software package, AI-HPC4CST promotes a **modular ecosystem**:

- Specialised tools  
- Clear interfaces  
- HPC-ready workflows  
- AI-enhanced optimisation strategies  

This modularity ensures flexibility, scalability, and long-term sustainability within the CST research community.
