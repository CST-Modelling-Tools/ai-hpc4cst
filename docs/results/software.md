## Software & Reproducible Workflows

AI-HPC4CST places strong emphasis on open science, transparency, and computational reproducibility.

All software developed within the project will be:

- Version controlled
- Publicly accessible (when possible)
- Properly documented
- Linked to publications and deliverables

---

## Core Principles

The software strategy of AI-HPC4CST is based on:

### 1. Open Development
Code is developed in public repositories under the CST-Modelling-Tools organization whenever feasible.

### 2. Reproducibility
Each research output will:

- Specify software versions
- Describe computational environments
- Provide reproducibility notes
- Link to datasets (if applicable)

### 3. Modularity
Tools are designed to:

- Interoperate with CST modelling frameworks
- Integrate AI components
- Scale across HPC systems
- Support optimisation workflows

---

## Tool Ecosystem

The project follows a distributed documentation model:

- The **main website** provides project context.
- Each major tool has its own development blog and repository.

### Tonatiuh++

CST ray-tracing and modelling toolkit.

Development blog:
https://cst-modelling-tools.github.io/tonatiuhpp-blog/

Repository:

---

## Upcoming Tools

Additional tools will be released during the project, potentially including:

- AI surrogate modelling frameworks  
- HPC workflow orchestration tools  
- Multi-objective optimisation modules  
- Integrated CST system simulation pipelines  

Each tool will include:

- Documentation
- Usage examples
- Versioned releases
- Change logs

---

## Versioning Policy

The project follows semantic versioning where appropriate.

Each release will include:

- Version number
- Release date
- Summary of changes
- Compatibility notes
- Associated publication references (if applicable)

---

## Computational Environments

Where necessary, the project may provide:

- Environment configuration files
- Container specifications
- Dependency lists
- Reproduction instructions

These resources will enable other researchers and practitioners to replicate key results.
