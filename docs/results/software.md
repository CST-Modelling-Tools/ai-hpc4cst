## Software and Reproducible Workflows

AI-HPC4CST places strong emphasis on open science, transparency, and computational reproducibility.

Software developed within the project supports simulation-driven optimisation, AI-enhanced search strategies, and scalable HPC execution.

Where appropriate, project software will be:

- Version controlled  
- Publicly accessible  
- Documented and maintained  
- Linked to associated publications  

---

## Core Principles

The software strategy of AI-HPC4CST is based on the following principles.

### 1. Open Development

Whenever feasible, software is developed in public repositories under the GitHub CST-Modelling-Tools organisation, promoting transparency and collaborative improvement.

### 2. Reproducibility

Research outputs are accompanied by:

- Clear specification of software versions  
- Description of computational environments  
- Documentation of optimisation workflows  
- References to input data or configuration files where applicable  

### 3. Modularity and Integration

Tools are designed to:

- Interoperate with solar tower simulation frameworks  
- Integrate AI-enhanced optimisation algorithms  
- Operate efficiently within HPC environments  
- Support scalable, simulation-in-the-loop workflows  

---

## Tool Ecosystem

The project follows a distributed documentation model:

- The main website provides project context and integration.  
- Individual tools maintain dedicated repositories and development documentation.
