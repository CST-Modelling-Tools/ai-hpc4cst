## Publications

This page collects scientific publications produced within the AI-HPC4CST project.

The project promotes open dissemination of results, transparent methodology, and reproducible computational research in the fields of optimisation, artificial intelligence, high-performance computing, and advanced solar energy systems.

As results become available, this page will be updated with complete and stable references.
